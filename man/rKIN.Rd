\title{rKIN: A package for computating isotopic niche space}
\description{
The rKIN This package applies methods used to estimate animal homerange, but
instead of geospatial coordinates, we use isotopic coordinates. The estimation
methods include: 1) 2-dimensional bivariate normal kernel utilization density
estimator with multiple bandwidth estimation methods, 2) bivariate normal
ellipse estimator, and 3) minimum convex polygon estimator, all applied to
stable isotope data. Additionally, functions to
determine niche area, polygon overlap between groups and levels (confidence
contours) and plotting capabilities.
